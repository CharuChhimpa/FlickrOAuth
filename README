Contains example code on how to authenticate using OAuth for the flickr API.  Uses the https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2 library, and the code was partially based off of the example code for that library.

You must create a file called "apikeys" that has your applications api_key on the first line and the secret on the second line, in order for this code to work.

This is my first attempt at both OAuth and Python, I understand there is some code refactoring that is needed.
